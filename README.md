#### Context
Colombia’s current situation regarding prison matters is very delicate and has generated plenty of controversy over the last few years due to the lack of capacity and adequate legislation. Since 1998, the overcrowding percentage has increased from 34% to nearly 50% in 2015 with roughly more than 42,000 convicts without a room. Moreover,  the attempts for solving this problem are very time consuming because they depend primarily on the judicial system which can take years for a law to make. Not to mention also that the betterment of the infrastructure requires high investments and bureaucratic processes that can be affected by administration changes. For this matter, the government has the need to evaluate the effectiveness of their criminal policy, including programs and services focused on individuals released from jails, to reduce the recidivism rate and therefore preventing, controlling and reducing the overcrowding rate mentioned.

#### Objective
Currently, the DPCP and the penitentiary entities are interested in characterizing the jail population in Colombia and their recidivism risk to establish patterns, tendencies, and groups to ensure an adequate formulation and monitoring of the criminal policy.

Recidivism is one of the critical indicators that allows measuring the impact that imprisonment has in the process of convict’s reinsertion in the society. In addition, it allows assessing the effectiveness of the policies that are being implemented in criminal law matter. Hence, we believe that in the development of this project we can positively impact social outcomes such as:

- Providing key and practical data-driven analysis and reference for the decision-making process of the resocialization policies
- Decreasing and optimizing public money spent on incarceration
- Guarantee an analysis focus on equity among historical and systemic disadvantage communities
- Provide key insights for making better strategies to reduce the recidivism risk
